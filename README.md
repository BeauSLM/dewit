# The Big Idea

A simple todo website with every piece of functionality backed by a REST api.

This allows updating of the todo list graphically OR programmatically.

# Features

##  Api

- todo items:
    - have priority (domain: that of a u8)
    - name
    - description
    - optional deadline
    - type/tag?
    - etc.
    - finished
- get random todo items of assorted priorities

## Web gui

- grapical method to call everything in the api
- checked off todo items
    - cross-through
    - faded out?
    - keep last 20
- dark mode and light mode (dark default cause i'm cool)
